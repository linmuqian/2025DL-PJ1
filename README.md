# 2025DL-PJ1
This is the Project 1 of Neutral Network and Deep Learning 2025 of Fudan University.

`mynn` is about hand-writing torch classes. The detailed information please read my report for this PJ.

`data augmentation.ipynb` and `data explorate.ipynb` is about data augmentation and data exploration, to get the overview of the code.

`draw tools` is to plot the picture about the train and dev set loss and accuracy.

`test train` is the executable code, to train the model.'test model' is the executable code, to use the model to test another set. Note: To ensure the code within these two folders can run properly, you need to place them in the parent folder. Additionally, the folder named "best models" will indicate which executable code corresponds to which model, along with its specific parameters, training plots, and training logs.

`best models` has folders. Each folder has a 'test model'(Python file), with the detailed parameters; `training log`(Excel file) and `training plot`(PNG file) record the detailed training log. Thus, this 'best model' folder can also be seen as the folder to save the model. 

`weight visialization` is about to visilize the weight of the saved model.
